Rdio Top Album Plays By User

Recently at [Harvest](http://getharvest.com), we internally shared our top 10 albums for 2013. I personally can't keep track of all the new music that comes out each year, let alone try and rank my favorites. So, this app was born out of a desire to see if I could get some insight on this information from the Rdio API. It was also an excuse to mess around with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), which I've been wanting to do for some time. I'm also using [Rdio's Simple Ruby library](https://github.com/rdio/rdio-simple/tree/master/ruby).
